##basic code

To make a ykan project you need to setup some things.

1. install YKAN
2. install glfw3

now let's go to the code (note this code i written in c but ykan for the reason
that is made in c libs that make other languages use ykan are easy to make)

```c
//import YKAN
#include <ykan.h>

//the update function
int update(){
  return,0
}


//the main function
int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {

  //the main struct
  ykApp app;

  //setup the struct
  app.name='app';
  app.createWindow=YkcreateWin;
  app.init=YkinitVk;
  //in this way you can create custom init functions for the best performance
  app.update=update;
  app.run=YkRun;

  //create window and init vulkan
  app.createWindow(420,500,"my app");
  app.init();

  //update (draw function)
  app.update();


  //the last line shoud be the run
  app.run();
  return 0;
}

```
